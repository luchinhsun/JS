If you commit some files, like aaa, and push it.
After that you use git reset to white-out that commit and modify aaa.
You will get a merge failed message when you want to push.
Use git pull, you will get conflict-resolution in that file aaa(or you use git status to see).
You need to change the file into what you want by manual,
then you can push it(can use git status to see the error message was gone).
